hid-cta-button
==============

**hid-cta-button** is a WordPress plugin which displays a simple, configurable call-to-action button in a page or post. There are some really nice plugins available at WordPress.org to do this, but I wanted a very simple one with no admin panel, only one pre-defined CSS class, and no additional configuration. 

To use it, copy the 'hid-cta-button' folder into wp-content/plugins. Then activate the plug-in in the WordPress control panel.

Use it by inserting a shortcode into a page or post like this:

`[hid-cta-button text="Contact Me" url="/contact-me"]`

The default CSS class applied to the button will be `.hid-cta-button`. You can optionally use a different class or classes to apply to the button like this:

`[hid-cta-button text="Contact Me" url="/contact-me" classes="mybutton red large"]`
